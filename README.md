# Funniest order ever!

**Story:** One student from college needed to do a graduate work. The task was to create simple educational platform with lectures and tests. Isn't it simple? Ha-ha, there were three rules:
- write code like a total newbie
- 14 hours to complete it (next day exam)
- explain all basics of react/express to this student in 3 hours :D

--------------------------------------

**All tasks were completed succefully and this student got 67/100 points**
